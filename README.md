# pull_requests
This Python script retrieves details from closed pull requests (PRs) of a GitHub repository using the GitHub REST API. It extracts metadata such as PR titles, descriptions, comments, and changes to source code files, saving this data in both a JSON file and a PostgreSQL database. The code also parses and extracts comments from modified files based on their type.

Features:
Pull Request Data Extraction: Retrieves metadata, comments, and changes from closed PRs.
File Comment Parsing: Extracts comments from modified files using regular expressions.
Data Storage:
        Saves PR data in a JSON file for offline analysis.
        Stores PR details and file changes in a PostgreSQL database.
Pagination Support: Handles API pagination for large repositories with multiple PRs.
Error Handling: Includes detailed error reporting for API requests and database operations.

      Install required libraries using:
        pip install requests psycopg2
